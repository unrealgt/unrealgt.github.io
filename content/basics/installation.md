The only way to install the plugin currently is to build it from Source:

1. Clone this repo and copy Plugins/ULab into your projects plugin Directory.

2. Generate VisualStudio project files by right clicking your projects `.uproject` file.

3. Launch the generated Solution

4. Select DebugGameEditor or DevelopmentGameEditor as Target and Run the build.

5. After the Editor has launched goto `Edit > Plugins` and enable the ULab plugin.

// TODO add prebuilt binary instructions?
