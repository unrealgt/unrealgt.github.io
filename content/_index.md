By means of synthetic data generation, large amounts of image- and metadata can be extracted directly from a virtual scene, which in turn can be customized to meet the specific needs of the algorithm or the use-case. Furthermore, the use of virtual objects avoids problems that might arise due to data protec- tion issues and does not require the use of expensive sensors. We propose a framework for synthetic test data generation utilizing the Unreal Engine.
